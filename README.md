# Introduction

2-D-to-3-D registration is critical and fundamental in image-guided interventions. It could be achieved from single image using paired point correspondences between the object and the image. **The common assumption that paired point correspondences can readily be established does NOT necessarily hold** for image guided interventions. Intraoperative image clutter and an imperfect feature extraction method may introduce false detection and, due to the physics of X-ray imaging, the 2-D image point features may be indistinguishable from each other and/or obscured by anatomy causing false detection of the point features. These create difficulties in establishing correspondences between image features and 3-D data points. In this paper, we propose an accurate, robust, and fast method to accomplish 2-D-to-3-D registration **using a single image without the need for establishing paired correspondences in the presence of false detections**. We formulate 2-D-3-D registration as a maximum likelihood estimation problem, which is then solved by **embeding Expectation Maximization (EM) in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**. The proposed method was evaluated in a phantom and a cadaver study. In the phantom study, it achieved **subdegree rotation errors** and **submillimeter in-plane (X-Y plane) translation errors**. In both studies, it outperformed the state-of-the-art methods that do not use paired correspondences and achieved the same accuracy as a state-of-the-art global optimal method that uses correct paired correspondences.

The **correspondence map** is a visualization of the correspondence probabilities $$p_{mn}$$ with the horizontal axis the order of image points and the vertical axis the order of model points. The higher the value of a block in the map is, the higher the correspondence probability is.

# How To Start

- Compile the C source code by mex calcQFcn_mex.c

- Rum the demo.m.

# Dependency

The source code is mostly self-contained.

The Particle Swarm Optimization is a modified pervious version of the Constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25986-constrained-particle-swarm-optimization).  Only the minimal required functions are included in this source code.  If you want to use the latest version of the Constrained Particle Swarm Optimization, proper modifications to the latest PSO and this source code may have to be made accordingly.

The function round2.m can be obtained from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4261-round2.
